# ArduinoScope
a small Processing sketch to view signals comming from the Arduino example sketch "AnalogReadSerial". Does basically the same as the serial plotter that ships with the Arduino software, with the exception that the serial-plotter auto-scales the y-axis and this sketch does not.

The checkPort sketch will return a list of ports in the console, to identify on which port the Arduino is connected. Change the port number in the oscilloscope sketch to match the correct port before running that sketch.
